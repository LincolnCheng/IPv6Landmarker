## What is IPv6Landmarker?

IPv6landmarker is an IPv6 network landmark-acquiring tool that can help you enhance your street-level IPv6 geolocation. 
1. It can extract EUI-64 IPv6 addresses from a IPv6 address list with 'Filter_EUI64.py'; 
2. It can acquire multi-association landmark set from the EUI-64 IPv6 addresses with 'IPv6Landmarker.py';
3. It can execute a multi-association coordinate filtering algorithm to output the landmarks with '1to3_Filter.py'.

## Input IPv6 addresses

* [IPv6 hitlist](https://ipv6hitlist.github.io/) 
* [IPv6 6scan](http://175.6.54.250/ipv6)

## Dependencies

* python3.06+
* BSSIDApple_pb2

## Paper

The approach is described in the paper submitted to the Computers & Security journal.

## Appreciate

Some of the code modeling the structure was borrowed from @6int's brilliant [IPvSeeYou](https://github.com/6int/IPvSeeYou), presented at Black Hat USA 2021.
